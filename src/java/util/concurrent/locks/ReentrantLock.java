/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
 * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
 * capabilities.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.
 *
 * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 *
 * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 * typically in a before/after construction such as:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
 *
